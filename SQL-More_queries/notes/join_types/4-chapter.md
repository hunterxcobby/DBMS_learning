**Set Operations on Tables:**

In Relational Algebra (RA) and SQL, set operations can be performed on tables, treating them as sets of rows. The primary set operations are union and minus:

1. **Union Operation:**
   - The union operation combines the rows from two tables and eliminates duplicates, resulting in a new table.
   - The tables involved in the union operation must have the same number of attributes, and corresponding attributes must be of the same data type.
   - Here's an example using SQL syntax:

     ```sql
     SELECT column1, column2, ...
     FROM table1
     UNION
     SELECT column1, column2, ...
     FROM table2;
     ```

2. **Minus Operation:**
   - The minus operation, also known as set difference, returns the rows from the left table that are not present in the right table.
   - As with the union operation, the tables must have the same number of attributes with corresponding data types.
   - Example using SQL:

     ```sql
     SELECT column1, column2, ...
     FROM table1
     MINUS
     SELECT column1, column2, ...
     FROM table2;
     ```

   It's important to note that both sets involved in these operations must contain objects of the same type, and the tables need to be appropriately structured for these operations to be valid and meaningful. Using the AS keyword to give tables the same name in the operation can enhance clarity and readability.
