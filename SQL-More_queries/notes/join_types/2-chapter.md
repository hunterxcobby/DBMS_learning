**Evaluation Order in Joins:**

In SQL, when you have multiple joins in a query, they are evaluated from left to right in the order you write them, unless you use parentheses to specify a different evaluation order. This means that the order of the joins in the query determines the order in which they are executed.

For example, given three tables (r1, r2, r3), the following two expressions are equivalent:

\[ r1 \bowtie r2 \bowtie r3 \]

\[ (r1 \bowtie r2) \bowtie r3 \]

In SQL syntax, it translates to:

```sql
-- Equivalent expressions
SELECT ...
FROM r1
JOIN r2 ON ...
JOIN r3 ON ...
```

```sql
-- Equivalent expressions with parentheses
SELECT ...
FROM (r1
JOIN r2 ON ...)
JOIN r3 ON ...
```

This evaluation order becomes particularly crucial when dealing with outer joins in combination with other joins. If outer joins are mixed with natural joins, you might inadvertently filter out rows that you intended to keep. For instance:

```sql
-- Incorrect order of joins
SELECT cFirstName, cLastName, orderDate, UPC, quantity
FROM customers 
LEFT OUTER JOIN orders USING (custID)
NATURAL JOIN orderlines;
```

The above query may lose customers who haven't placed orders because the `NATURAL JOIN orderlines` is applied before the `LEFT OUTER JOIN`. To ensure all customers are retained, you can force the correct evaluation order using parentheses:

```sql
-- Correct order of joins
SELECT cFirstName, cLastName, orderDate, UPC, quantity
FROM customers 
LEFT OUTER JOIN (orders NATURAL JOIN orderlines) USING (custID);
```

This ensures that the `LEFT OUTER JOIN` is executed first, preserving all customers, and then the `NATURAL JOIN` is applied to the result. Understanding and controlling the evaluation order is essential for constructing accurate queries, especially when dealing with complex join conditions and outer joins.
