The UNIQUE constraint in MySQL ensures that all values in a specified column are unique, meaning no two rows can have the same value in that column. Think of it like a product catalog where each item must have a distinct identifier.

In the provided example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Brands(Id INTEGER, BrandName VARCHAR(30) UNIQUE);
```

This creates a table named Brands with a column BrandName set as UNIQUE, ensuring each brand name is unique.

```sql
INSERT INTO Brands VALUES(1, 'Coca Cola');
INSERT INTO Brands VALUES(2, 'Pepsi');
```

These insertions succeed because both brand names are unique.

```sql
INSERT INTO Brands VALUES(3, 'Pepsi');
```

However, this insertion fails because it violates the UNIQUE constraint. You're attempting to insert a row with a brand name ('Pepsi') that already exists in the BrandName column.

It's important to note that a PRIMARY KEY constraint automatically includes a UNIQUE constraint, ensuring the uniqueness of the primary key values. This is similar to having a unique identifier for each record in a database.
