The SET constraint in MySQL allows a column to have zero or more values, each chosen from a predefined list of permitted values. Let's examine the example with the Students table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Students(Id INTEGER, Name VARCHAR(55), Certificates SET('A1', 'A2', 'B1', 'C1'));
```

This creates the Students table with columns Id, Name, and Certificates. The Certificates column is defined as a SET, permitting values from the specified list ('A1', 'A2', 'B1', 'C1').

```sql
INSERT INTO Students VALUES(1, 'Paul', 'A1,B1');
INSERT INTO Students VALUES(2, 'Jane', 'A1,B1,A2');
INSERT INTO Students VALUES(3, 'Mark', 'A1,A2,D1,D2');
```

The insertions demonstrate that each student can have zero or more certificates selected from the predefined list.

```sql
SELECT * FROM Students;
```

The SELECT statement displays the contents of the Students table:

```
+------+------+--------------+
| Id   | Name | Certificates |
+------+------+--------------+
|    1 | Paul | A1,B1        |
|    2 | Jane | A1,A2,B1     |
|    3 | Mark | A1,A2        |
+------+------+--------------+
```

As seen in the result, each row in the Certificates column can contain multiple values, separated by commas. This is in contrast to the ENUM constraint, where each column can have only one distinct value from the list of permitted values.

Using SET constraints allows flexibility in representing multiple choices within a single column, suitable for scenarios where an entity can have a combination of attributes.
