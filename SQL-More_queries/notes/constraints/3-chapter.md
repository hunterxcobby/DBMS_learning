The PRIMARY KEY constraint in MySQL uniquely identifies each record in a database table. It's a special type of unique key, and it ensures that the key's values are unique and cannot be NULL. The primary key is crucial for database design, serving as a unique identifier for each record, and it becomes a foreign key in other tables to establish relationships.

In the provided example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Brands(Id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, BrandName VARCHAR(30) UNIQUE);
```

This creates a table named Brands with the Id column as the primary key and BrandName with a UNIQUE constraint.

The `DESCRIBE Brands;` statement reveals information about the table's structure:

```
+-----------+-------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| Field     | Type        | Null | Key | Default | Extra |
+-----------+-------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| Id        | int(11)     | NO   | PRI | NULL    |       |
| BrandName | varchar(30) | YES  | UNI | NULL    |       |
+-----------+-------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
```

This output shows that the Id column is a PRIMARY KEY (PRI), and the BrandName column has a UNIQUE constraint (UNI). The primary key uniquely identifies each row in the Brands table, and the unique constraint ensures that brand names are not duplicated.

Remember, primary keys are used for referencing specific rows within a table, and they become foreign keys when establishing relationships between tables.
