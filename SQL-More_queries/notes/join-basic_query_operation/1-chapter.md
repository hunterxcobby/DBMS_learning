In SQL, the basic query operation for combining data from two or more tables is called a join. The join is specified in the FROM clause of the SQL statement. Let's explore this concept with an example:

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM customers
NATURAL JOIN orders;
```

In this example, the NATURAL JOIN keyword is used to join the Customers and Orders tables. The NATURAL JOIN specifies that the attributes whose values will be matched between the two tables are those with matching names. Typically, these attributes are the primary key (pk) and foreign key (fk) attributes, and they must have matching data types.

The result of this query includes all columns from both the Customers and Orders tables, with the attributes {cfirstname, clastname, cphone} shown only once since they are the matching attributes. The result set displays customer data along with all orders that each customer has placed.

It's important to note the following observations from the result:
1. Customer information is repeated for each order, reflecting the one-to-many relationship between Customers and Orders.
2. Customers who have not placed an order are missing from the results, as there is no foreign key in the Orders table to match their primary key in the Customers table.

While NATURAL JOIN is used here, it's worth mentioning that not all database systems support this keyword, and you may need to use alternative syntax for joins depending on the system. Different join types, such as INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, and others, can be employed to achieve specific results, and we'll cover those in later discussions.
