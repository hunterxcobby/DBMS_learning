In Relational Algebra (RA), the join operation between two relations, \(r\) over scheme \(R\) and \(s\) over scheme \(S\), is denoted as \(r ⋈ s\), which is equivalent to the SQL JOIN operation. In the example, \(customers ⋈ orders\) represents the join of the Customers and Orders relations.

### Result Scheme:
The scheme of the result is the union of the two relation schemes, \(R∪S\). The join attributes are found in the intersection of the two schemes, \(R∩S\). The attributes in the intersection must follow the same assignment rule from both \(R\) and \(S\), ensuring compatibility.

### Result Tuples:
The result of the RA join consists of the pairwise paste of all tuples from the two relations. This can be represented as \(paste(t, u)\) for any tuple \(t\) from relation \(r\) over scheme \(R\) and \(u\) from relation \(s\) over scheme \(S\). The result of the paste operation is essentially the combination of attributes from both relations where the join attributes match.

### Special Case:
In the rare case where there is no intersection between schemes \(R\) and \(S\) (that is, \(R∩S = \{\text{null}\}\)), the schemes are still considered compatible. In this scenario, every tuple from relation \(r\) is pasted to every tuple from relation \(s\), with all attributes from both schemes contained in the resulting tuples. This situation is akin to a Cartesian product of the two relations and is represented as \(r × s\) in RA or explicitly specified in SQL with the CROSS JOIN keyword.

Visualizing these operations involves understanding the three possible results of the paste operation, considering the graphic representation of schemes and tuples presented in earlier pages.
