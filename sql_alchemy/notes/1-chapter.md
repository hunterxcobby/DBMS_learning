the SQLAlchemy Object Relational Mapper (ORM) tutorial for an absolute beginner.

### Object Relational Mapper (ORM) Basics:

**1. Purpose of SQLAlchemy ORM:**
   - SQLAlchemy ORM associates Python classes with database tables and instances of those classes with rows in corresponding tables.
   - Provides a way to synchronize changes in state between Python objects and database rows.

**2. Unit of Work:**
   - The ORM introduces the concept of a "unit of work," which transparently manages changes between objects and their related database rows.

**3. Usage Patterns:**
   - The ORM is distinct from the SQLAlchemy Expression Language.
   - Expression Language represents relational database constructs directly.
   - ORM abstracts usage, focusing on a user-defined domain model.

**4. Overlapping Usage:**
   - While there is some overlap between ORM and Expression Language, their perspectives on data structure and content differ.

**5. Application Construction:**
   - A successful application can be constructed using the ORM exclusively.
   - In advanced scenarios, the Expression Language might be used in specific areas requiring direct database interactions.

**6. Version Check:**
   - Ensure you are using at least version 1.3 of SQLAlchemy.

```python
>>> import sqlalchemy
>>> sqlalchemy.__version__
1.3.0
```

### Connecting to Database:

**1. Database Engine:**
   - Use `create_engine()` to connect to a database.
   - Example using an in-memory SQLite database:

```python
>>> from sqlalchemy import create_engine
>>> engine = create_engine('sqlite:///:memory:', echo=True)
```

   - `echo=True` enables logging of SQL statements for better understanding (you can set it to `False` for less output).

**2. Lazy Connecting:**
   - The `Engine` instance returned by `create_engine()` does not immediately connect to the database.
   - The actual connection occurs the first time a task is performed against the database.

**3. Engine Methods:**
   - Methods like `Engine.execute()` or `Engine.connect()` trigger the first-time connection.
