Certainly, let's delve into querying with SQLAlchemy:

1. **Basic Querying:**
   - Create a `Query` object using `session.query(User)`.
   - Iterate over the results, printing the name and fullname of each user, ordered by their IDs.

```python
for instance in session.query(User).order_by(User.id):
    print(instance.name, instance.fullname)
```

2. **Querying Specific Columns:**
   - Retrieve only the `name` and `fullname` columns from the `User` table.
   - Iterate over the results, printing the name and fullname.

```python
for name, fullname in session.query(User.name, User.fullname):
    print(name, fullname)
```

3. **Querying as Named Tuples:**
   - Querying as named tuples, with attribute names derived from the class.
   - Iterate over the results, printing the User and name.

```python
for row in session.query(User, User.name).all():
    print(row.User, row.name)
```

4. **Controlled Naming with `label()`:**
   - Control the names of individual column expressions using `label()`.
   - Iterate over the results, printing the `name_label`.

```python
for row in session.query(User.name.label('name_label')).all():
    print(row.name_label)
```

5. **Aliasing Entities with `aliased()`:**
   - Use `aliased()` to control the name of a full entity.
   - Iterate over the results, printing the aliased entity.

```python
user_alias = aliased(User, name='user_alias')
for row in session.query(user_alias, user_alias.name).all():
    print(row.user_alias)
```

6. **Limiting and Offsetting Results:**
   - Limit and offset the results, printing a subset of users.

```python
for u in session.query(User).order_by(User.id)[1:3]:
    print(u)
```

7. **Filtering Results:**
   - Filter results using `filter_by()` and `filter()` for more complex conditions.
   - Print the names of users with the fullname 'Ed Jones'.

```python
for name, in session.query(User.name).filter_by(fullname='Ed Jones'):
    print(name)

for name, in session.query(User.name).filter(User.fullname == 'Ed Jones'):
    print(name)
```

The `Query` object is powerful and flexible, allowing you to construct complex queries and filter results based on specific conditions.
