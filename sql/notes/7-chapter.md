**1. Delete Statement:**
It's like removing things from your table. Imagine your table is a list, and you're crossing out items you don't need anymore. Here's how:

```sql
DELETE FROM <table name>
WHERE <condition>;
```

This says, "In the 'table,' delete the rows where the 'condition' is met." If you forget the condition, it will delete everything in the table, which is usually not what you want.

**2. Commit and Rollback:**
When you make changes in a big playground with many kids (a multi-user system), your changes are private until you decide to share them. It's like saying, "Okay, I'm done playing with this. Let others see it." You do this by typing:

```sql
COMMIT;
```

If you realize you made a mess and want to undo everything you've done (but only if you haven't committed yet), it's like saying, "Oops, let's go back to how it was before":

```sql
ROLLBACK;
```

These commit and rollback things are like saving and undoing changes, but they're more crucial in large playgrounds with many kids (users) playing at the same time. In a small, single-user playground, you usually don't need to worry about it.
