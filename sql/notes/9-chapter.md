**1. SELECT Clause:**
   - This is where you specify the columns you want to retrieve in your result.
   - You can use a comma-separated list of attribute names, like `SELECT FirstName, LastName`.
   - If you want all columns, you can use an asterisk (*), like `SELECT *`.

**2. FROM Clause:**
   - Specifies the table from which you want to retrieve rows.
   - If you're getting data from a single table, this is where you mention that table's name, like `FROM Employees`.

**3. WHERE Clause (Optional):**
   - Used to filter rows based on certain conditions.
   - You specify a boolean predicate, like `WHERE Salary > 50000`, which means you only want rows where the salary is greater than 50000.

**4. ORDER BY Clause (Optional):**
   - Provides a way to sort the display of the rows in the result.
   - You mention the column(s) by which you want to order and can specify ascending (ASC) or descending (DESC) order, like `ORDER BY Salary DESC`.

**Tips:**
   - The first two clauses, SELECT and FROM, are required. The WHERE and ORDER BY clauses are optional.
   - When learning, it helps to follow a step-by-step sequence, check the data after each modification, and understand the results at each step.
   - Iterative refinement helps in honing the SQL statement to retrieve the desired information.
