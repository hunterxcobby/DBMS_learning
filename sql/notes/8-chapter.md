**1. Retrieval Process:**
   - To get data from our tables, we use the SELECT statement in SQL.
   - The result of this statement is like a virtual table, not stored in the database but available for viewing or using in programming.
   - It's the tool we use to fetch and display information.

**2. Basic Syntax:**
   - The SELECT statement has four main parts, or clauses:
      - **SELECT {attribute}+:** This is where you list the columns you want to see in your result. If you want all columns, you can use an asterisk (*).
      - **FROM {table}+:** Here, you specify the table from which you want to retrieve data.
      - **[ WHERE {boolean predicate to pick rows} ]:** You can filter your results based on conditions. For example, you might want only the rows where a certain column has a specific value.
      - **[ ORDER BY {attribute}+ ]:** This part is optional. It helps you sort the result based on a column. For instance, you might want to see the data sorted by date or in alphabetical order.

**3. Example:**
   - Let's say you have a table called "Employees" with columns like "EmployeeID," "FirstName," and "Salary."
   - If you want to see the "FirstName" and "Salary" of all employees with a salary greater than 50000, sorted by salary in descending order, your SQL query might look like this:

```sql
SELECT FirstName, Salary
FROM Employees
WHERE Salary > 50000
ORDER BY Salary DESC;
```

   - This says, "From the 'Employees' table, show the first names and salaries of employees where the salary is more than 50000, and arrange them in descending order of salary."

Remember, SQL is not case-sensitive, but many developers use uppercase for keywords for clarity.
