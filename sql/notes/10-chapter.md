**1. Initial Query:**
   - Start by retrieving all relevant data; in this case, all customer data.
   - Since we want all columns, use `SELECT * FROM customers;`

**2. First Refinement (Filter by Zip Code):**
   - Refine the query to retrieve only customers in the specified zip code.
   - Use `WHERE cZipCode = '90840';` to filter by the desired zip code.

**3. Second Refinement (Select Specific Columns):**
   - Now, refine the query to retrieve only specific columns (first name, last name, and phone).
   - Use `SELECT cLastName, cFirstName, cPhone FROM customers WHERE cZipCode = '90840';`

**4. Third Refinement (Order the Results):**
   - Further refine the query to order the results alphabetically by last name and first name.
   - Use `ORDER BY cLastName ASC, cFirstName ASC;`

**Result:**
   - The final refined query is:
   ```sql
   SELECT cLastName, cFirstName, cPhone
   FROM customers
   WHERE cZipCode = '90840'
   ORDER BY cLastName ASC, cFirstName ASC;
   ```
   - The result set displays customers in zip code 90840, sorted alphabetically by last name and first name.

**Notes:**
   - SQL keywords like SELECT and FROM are not case-sensitive, but literal strings (like '90840') are case-sensitive.
   - The ORDER BY clause is used for presentation purposes and does not alter the meaning of the results.
   - ASC is used for ascending order (optional, as it's the default), and DESC can be used for descending order.
