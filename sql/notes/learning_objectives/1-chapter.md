**What's a Database:**
A database is a structured collection of data that is organized in a way that facilitates efficient storage, retrieval, and management of information. It acts as a central repository where data can be easily accessed, managed, and updated. Databases are used to store various types of information, such as text, numbers, images, and more, and they play a crucial role in computer systems and applications. They provide a systematic and organized approach to data management, allowing users to interact with and manipulate information for various purposes.

**What's a Relational Database:**
A relational database is a type of database that organizes data into tables, where each table consists of rows and columns. The relationships between different tables are defined based on common attributes, creating a structured and interconnected data model. In a relational database, data integrity is maintained through the use of keys, such as primary keys and foreign keys, which ensure that information is accurate and consistent across related tables. The Structured Query Language (SQL) is commonly used to interact with and manipulate data in relational databases. The relational model provides a flexible and efficient way to manage and retrieve data, making it a widely adopted approach in database management systems.
