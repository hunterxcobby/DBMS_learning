In the context of databases and SQL:

- **DDL stands for Data Definition Language:**
  - It is a subset of SQL used for defining and managing the structure of a database.
  - DDL commands include statements like `CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP`, and `TRUNCATE`.
  - Examples:
    - `CREATE TABLE`: Defines a new table.
    - `ALTER TABLE`: Modifies an existing table structure.
    - `DROP TABLE`: Deletes an existing table.
    - `CREATE INDEX`: Creates an index on one or more columns of a table.

- **DML stands for Data Manipulation Language:**
  - It is a subset of SQL used for managing data stored in the database.
  - DML commands include statements like `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`.
  - Examples:
    - `SELECT`: Retrieves data from one or more tables.
    - `INSERT INTO`: Adds new records into a table.
    - `UPDATE`: Modifies existing records in a table.
    - `DELETE FROM`: Removes records from a table.

In summary, DDL is focused on defining and managing the structure of the database (tables, indexes, etc.), while DML is focused on manipulating the data stored within the database (querying, inserting, updating, deleting records).
