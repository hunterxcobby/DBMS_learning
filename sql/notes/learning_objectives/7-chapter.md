Constraints in SQL are used to define rules and relationships for the data in tables. They ensure data integrity and enforce certain conditions on columns. Let's explore a few types of constraints and how they can be used:

### 1. Primary Key Constraint:

The primary key constraint is used to uniquely identify each record in a table. It must contain unique values, and it cannot have NULL values. It is declared during the table creation:

```sql
CREATE TABLE TableName (
    Column1 DataType1 PRIMARY KEY,
    Column2 DataType2
);
```

To validate its purpose, try inserting duplicate or NULL values into the primary key column, and you will receive an error indicating a violation of the primary key constraint.

### 2. Foreign Key Constraint:

Foreign key constraints establish a link between two tables based on the values of a column in both tables. It ensures referential integrity. For example, if you have a table `Orders` with a foreign key referencing the `Customers` table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Orders (
    OrderID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    CustomerID INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (CustomerID) REFERENCES Customers(CustomerID)
);
```

This ensures that every `CustomerID` in the `Orders` table must exist in the `Customers` table. If you try to insert a row with a non-existing `CustomerID`, it will violate the foreign key constraint.

### 3. Check Constraint:

A check constraint is used to limit the range of values that a column can hold. For instance, ensuring that the age column is always greater than or equal to zero:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Persons (
    PersonID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Age INT CHECK (Age >= 0),
    ...
);
```

If you try to insert a negative age, it will violate the check constraint.

### 4. Unique Constraint:

The unique constraint ensures that all values in a column are unique:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Students (
    StudentID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Email VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE,
    ...
);
```

If you try to insert a row with a duplicate email, it will violate the unique constraint.

To validate these constraints, try inserting data that violates the defined rules, and you'll see error messages indicating constraint violations.
