1. **Character Strings (Text):** Think of it like writing words. There are two kinds - VARCHAR for flexible length and CHAR for fixed length. VARCHAR is like an elastic string - it stretches to fit the text, while CHAR is a fixed-size string.

   Example:
   - `VARCHAR(255)` means a variable string with a maximum length of 255 characters.
   - `CHAR(10)` means a fixed string always with 10 characters.

2. **Numeric Types (Numbers):** This is for dealing with numbers. You have things like NUMBER or INTEGER. The precision part is like saying how many decimal places you want to be precise about.

   Example:
   - `NUMBER(10, 2)` means a number with a total of 10 digits, 2 of which are after the decimal point.
   - `INTEGER` is for whole numbers.

3. **Date Types (Dates and Time):** This is for handling dates and times. You might just see DATE, and it's pretty self-explanatory.

   Example:
   - `DATE` means a date without a specific time.

Remember, the exact syntax might vary between different database systems, so always check the documentation for the specific rules of the software you're using. Think of these data types as the building blocks for your data, helping the database understand what kind of information it's dealing with.
