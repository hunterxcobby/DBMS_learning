## Data Manipulation Language (DML). 
It's like the toolkit for playing with the actual data in your tables.

When you're connected to a database, it's like having your own sandbox to play in. Nobody else can see your changes until you're done or tell the system you're finished. The SELECT statement is part of DML, and you've seen itâ€”it's like grabbing stuff from the sandbox without changing anything.

So, imagine your database is a playground, and DML is the set of tools you use to shape and mold the sand (data) the way you want. You can fetch data with SELECT and then use other DML statements to add, update, or delete stuff as needed. It's like your personal data playground.
