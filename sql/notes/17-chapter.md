In SQL, subqueries are employed when you need to retrieve information that you don't have when designing the main query. Here's an example:

1. **Problem:**
   - Find the name of customers who live in the same zip code area as Wayne Dick.

2. **Approach:**
   - Start by writing a subquery to find Wayne Dick's zip code.

     ```sql
     SELECT cZipCode
     FROM Customers
     WHERE cFirstName = 'Wayne' AND cLastName = 'Dick';
     ```

   - Use the result of the subquery in the main query to find customers with the same zip code.

     ```sql
     SELECT cFirstName, cLastName, cZipCode
     FROM customers
     WHERE cZipCode =        
       (SELECT cZipCode
        FROM customers
        WHERE cFirstName = 'Wayne' AND cLastName = 'Dick');
     ```

3. **Result:**
   - Customers who live in the same zip code as Wayne Dick are retrieved.

     ```
     Alvaro	Monge	90840
     Wayne	Dick	90840
     ```

4. **Explanation:**
   - The subquery is enclosed in parentheses and is used in the main query's `WHERE` clause to filter customers based on Wayne Dick's zip code.
   - Subqueries that return a single column and a single row can be used to provide a single value for conditions in the main query.
   - Subqueries can also be used for more complex conditions or when multiple values are needed.

Subqueries offer a powerful way to dynamically retrieve information needed for a specific condition in a query, allowing for flexibility in querying the database.
