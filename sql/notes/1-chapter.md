## SQL

In SQL, we have two main types of statements: Data Definition Language (DDL) and Data Manipulation Language (DML).

DDL is like the architect of your database. It helps you create and modify the structure of your tables and other important things in your database. When you run a DDL statement, it makes changes right away.

For example, the "CREATE TABLE" statement is like telling the database, "Hey, I want a new table with these attributes and data types." It's the blueprint for your table. It might look like this:

```sql
CREATE TABLE <table name> ( 
    <attribute name 1> <data type 1>,
    ...
    <attribute name n> <data type n>
);
```

This is how you start building the foundation of your database, defining what each part should look like. If you want to become a SQL master, it's a good idea to check the specific details for your database software, but this gives you the basic idea.
